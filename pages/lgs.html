<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Love GuySelf is a campaign that helps to expand education and awareness of low self-esteem in males. The campaign focuses on the issue of young men with low self-esteem and how it could be improved by regularly practicing self-love and self-care.</p>


<!-- I M P O R T A N T    Q U E S T I O N S ------------------------->
<h2>Audience</h2>
<h3>Who</h3>
<p>The target audience are high-schoolers (aged 14-18) identifying as male, and who have low self-esteem. High school boys are also more mature than middle schoolers and can have a better grasp the importance of self-love and care. Also unlike middle schoolers, high schoolers have a greater digital reach, since they have used social media platforms for longer and have more developed online social networks.</p>
<p>The secondary audience is people who identify as a male that does not fall into the age range of our target audience. They can use the campaign to apply and care for their own lives, since they may be exposed to some of the self-care and love practices that the high school guys in their lives exposes them to. Below is a survey we conducted, and the questions are viewable at this <a href="https://forms.gle/p4ZABwk2bwcu2nnc7" target="_blank" title="Link to Google Doc">link</a>.</p>

<h2>Graphic Standard Development</h2>

<h3>Logo Development</h3>
<p>The words “Love GuySelf” in the logo may be removed only in certain pieces of merchandise, but with all printed materials it must be included. Logos must not be warped or rotated, and if placed over the pattern the logo must be white for best visibility. Logos should be at least a distance of 1/3 of the width of the logo from other elements. There must be no misspelling of the logo, and GuySelf must have both the G and S capitalized. Since our target audience is geared towards high school boys, we wanted our logo to associate the idea of love and be able to impart congeniality to the targeted audience. The sketches were initially based on the shape of the heart with a face.</p>
<p>The logo of the campaign resembles a male’s face. It consists of the letters L, O, V, and E for “Love.” The V and O are the eyes of the figure, and the V represents a wink. G and S stand for “Guy” and “Self,” and form the face and hair. All the logos without a red “x” are acceptable uses.</p>

<h3>Illustration</h3>
<p>We picked items that could be applicable to high school boys. We narrowed down the ideal/related activities or items that boys normally do or use: caps, backpack, skateboard, game controller, headphone, cellphone, football, and soccer. Some of the product illustrations emphasize hygiene such as a shaver, toothbrush, soap, and deodorant.</p>
<p>The line is the most fundamental form of art and it is straightforward and simplistic. The illustrations are drawn by the non-dominant hand in order to break away from the typical line work. By drawing with the non-dominant hand, the illustrations became more unique in style and conveyed a sense of youthfulness.</p>

<h3>Photo Treatment</h3>
<p>The Love GuySelf photo treatments can be shown below. Photos are first made into black and white, then adjusted for contrast and exposure. Rectangles consistent with the color scheme of the campaign has its blending mode changed to “color” in Photoshop. The rectangles stretch from the top to the bottom and are placed over some part of the faces of models present in the photos. Finally, white illustrative lines of different weights are used to show expression of emotion in the models, and to convey a mood. Images may be rotated but may not be warped or tinted.</p>

<h2>Digital Marketing</h2>
<p>On May 10th 2019, we have launched our campaign through social media such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Every week we uploaded motivational quotes that associate with low self-esteem and self-love and care and hoped to boost up one’s self-esteem and encourage confidence.</p>
<p>We also created a special spotify playlist for listeners to enjoy. The playlist consists different themes of songs that helps one to study, meditate or hype up to feel the emotional connection through music. Within only a couple of weeks, our campaign has reached 34 followers on Instagram and 42 people liked our Facebook page.</p>

<h2>Physical Marketing</h2>
<p>The campaign will take on a few select representatives from each school, whom are called “Fellows,” that give talks of self love and care on behalf of the campaign at school functions. Fellows are chosen based on merit and volunteering hours, and are given an exclusive enamel pin to show their fellowship to the Love GuySelf Campaign.</p>

<h3>Care Package</h3>
<p>In addition to the branding merchandise, we developed a hygiene-centered care package, which is the first step for high school students to take care of their physical being. By starting with the physical, we wanted the outcome to assist in improving mental health.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pack of Mints, encourages freshness of breath and memes</li>
    <li>Sunscreen SPF 30, supports good skincare, especially in gym</li>
    <li>Hand Sanitizer, kills bacteria like the enemies of angsty teens</li>
</ul>
<p>These care packages are handed out in school functions, which we hope would draw the attention and awareness of students to our campaign, so they think we are “cool.”</p>

<h3>Fellows Program</h3>
<p>Once accepted, they are given an enamel pin and an invitation card exclusive to fellowship, which cannot be purchased. By having student representatives as ambassadors of our campaign, we can have an established attainable audience. Fellows are the same age group, and same demographic as their peers in school, and students will feel more comfortable reaching out to the campaign through them. Fellows are also able to share their experiences regarding self love and care, and any obstacles related to self-esteem issues that they overcame.</p>

<h3>Merchandise</h3>
<p>We hope to achieve raising awareness of the issues of low self-esteem in high school boys with our merchandise. We believe delivering educational material and effective merchandise will give a significant impact on the students about the campaign. All the merchandise we designed to produce is specifically aimed toward our target audience with meaningful purpose. For example, the hygiene-centered care package is prepared for students to remind to take care of themselves and stay sanitary. We are planning on producing more merchandise from 10% of the merchandise funds and the rest will be donated to our partnered resources that support self-love and self-care.</p>
