Hosting to your GitHub

1. Open your profile and create a new repository/repo/file
2. Once you are in your new repository, drag and drop the ENTIRE contents of the main folder into the repository.
3. Wait for GitHub to process the files
4. Go into the "Settings" tab at the top of the page
5. After going to the settings, scroll down (you should already be in the "Options" tab shown on the left sidebar) until you get to "GitHub Pages"
6. Scroll back down to "Github Pages"
7. Select "Master Branch" as the source (the page will reload)
8. Leave "Theme Chooser" blank (I've created the styling for you in the .css file)
9. The site is viewable online (live) already at yourgithubusername.github.io/yourrepositoryname (you should swap the names to your actual username and repository name)
10. Then we will attach your actual domain to your Github Project!



Linking your Domain to GitHub (the web hosting account)

1. Open the link to the place where you have purchased your domain from
2. On that page, navigate to the place where you manage your domains
3. Select the domain you want to change and click its settings
4. Click "manage DNS" or "DNS settings"
5. Navigate to "Records"
6. Make 5 changes by clicking "Add" and create the following 5 records
   1. Type: A, Name/Host: @, PointsTo/Value: 185.199.108.153, TTL: 1/2hr
   2. Type: A, Name/Host: @, PointsTo/Value: 185.199.109.153, TTL: 1/2hr
   3. Type: A, Name/Host: @, PointsTo/Value: 185.199.110.153, TTL: 1/2hr
   4. Type: A, Name/Host: @, PointsTo/Value: 185.199.111.153, TTL: 1/2hr
   5. Type: CNAME, Name/Host: www, PointsTo/Value: githubusername.github.io, TTL: 1hr
	- Sometimes CNAME gives an error, but GitHub recognizes the first four records without it
	- If error persists, keep the tab open and continue to next step
7. Open your GitHub Repo in a new tab
8. Navigate back to Settings (Options tab)
9. Scroll back down to "GitHub Pages"
10. You should see a green notification that says "Your site is published at..." With your domain
11. Check to see if the domain displays correctly by clicking the link
12. Back on the "GitHub Pages" section, check the box that says "Enforce HTTPS"
	- This may take a while (At least 24 hrs)
	- This step is just for security and not necessary for the site to actually work/display
13. Hooray! You've got a live site!
